# IFL
Iterative Fused LASSO 

## üîÄ Multi-Language Support

This project is implemented in both **R** and **Julia**:

- üìÅ [R version](./R): All code and documentation using the R language
- üìÅ [Julia version](./Julia): Equivalent implementation using Julia

Each version is self-contained and includes its own scripts, functions, and example usage.

We aim to develop a time series modeling methodology tailored to high-dimensional settings, addressing two critical challenges: the detection of structural breaks and the selection of relevant variables from a large pool of candidates. This effort centers on formulating a least squares estimation problem with regularization constraints, drawing on techniques such as fused LASSO and adaptive LASSO. 

The IFL is an efficient algorithm capable of handling high-dimensional cases within practical time limits. By addressing these pivotal challenges, our methodology holds the potential for widespread adoption. To enhance the algorithm's performance, we also incorporated outlier handling, as outliers are typically inconsistent with the dynamics of the underlying time series process.
